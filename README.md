# Warehouse Management Android App
The system developed for the needs of the present project is classified in the type "Autonomous Warehouse Management Systems", as the main feature of this type is its simplicity in terms of the management features it offers. More specifically, the purpose of the application is the management of a food warehouse, which monitors the processes of receiving and sending boxes. Through the application, the user can scan the Quick Response Code (QR Code) located outside the box, thus adding the stock of the product to the local database of the warehouse, but also to the central database (in case this warehouse is a branch of a main one).

The diagram below shows a typical use of the app, combining its functions and the ways in which they interact with the user's decisions.

In the design of the application, particular attention was paid to simplifying the user interface, with a view to enabling the user to become immediately familiar with it. More specifically, the menu was placed at the bottom of the application, as it is the closest point to the palm of the hand and thus facilitates the user, since he does not have to make large movements with his thumb. Also worth mentioning, it is the automatic switching between the QR code scanner and the list of products immediately after scanning a code, because it speeds up the production process by allowing the user to check if the product data entered into the database is correct.

Below is the final design of the app on a Storyboard.
